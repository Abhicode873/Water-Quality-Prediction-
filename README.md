# Water-Quality-Prediction-
This project focuses on building a predictive model to estimate the future quality of river water using historical pollution data. Using over two decades (2000–2021) of measurements from 22 monitoring stations along the Southern Bug River in Ukraine, we developed a machine learning pipeline to analyze, train, and forecast key water quality indicators.

The primary goal is to support environmental monitoring efforts by predicting the levels of various pollutants—such as Ammonium (NH₄), Nitrate (NO₃), Nitrite (NO₂), Phosphate (PO₄), Chloride (Cl⁻), and others—up to the year 2100. The model is built using the Random Forest Regressor due to its robustness and high performance on nonlinear data.
